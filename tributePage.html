      <p>Aryabhata or Aryabhata I (476–550 CE) was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Āryabhaṭīya (which mentions that in 3600 Kali Yuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years old) and the Arya-siddhanta.
      For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.</p>

      <h2>Time and place of birth</h2>
      <p>Aryabhata mentions in the Aryabhatiya that he was 23 years old 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, but this is not to mean that the text was composed at that time. This mentioned year corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476. Aryabhata called himself a native of Kusumapura or Pataliputra (present day Patna, Bihar).</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>It is fairly certain that, at some point, he went to Kusumapura for advanced studies and lived there for some time.[14] Both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as well as Bhāskara I (CE 629), identify Kusumapura as Pāṭaliputra, modern Patna.[9] A verse mentions that Aryabhata was the head of an institution (kulapa) at Kusumapura, and, because the university of Nalanda was in Pataliputra at the time and had an astronomical observatory, it is speculated that Aryabhata might have been the head of the Nalanda university as well.[9] Aryabhata is also reputed to have set up an observatory at the Sun temple in Taregana, Bihar.[15]</p>

      <h2>Works</h2>
      <p>Aryabhata is the author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which are lost.
        <br><br>
        He was student of Nalanda university, later he even became head of one department of it. Many researches were made at Nalanda in astronomy, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine and other fields. So Aryabhata got his major source of knowledge from Nalanda and his major work was based on previous inventions by Greeks, Mesapotamians and Nalanda university itself. Aryabhatiya, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was referred to in the Indian mathematical literature and has survived to modern times. The mathematical part of the Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry. It also contains continued fractions, quadratic equations, sums-of-power series, and a table of sines.
        <br><br>
        Direct details of Aryabhata's work are known only from the Aryabhatiya. The name "Aryabhatiya" is due to later commentators. Aryabhata himself may not have given it a name. His disciple Bhaskara I calls it Ashmakatantra (or the treatise from the Ashmaka). It is also occasionally referred to as Arya-shatas-aShTa (literally, Aryabhata's 108), because there are 108 verses in the text. It is written in the very terse style typical of sutra literature, in which each line is an aid to memory for a complex system. Thus, the explication of meaning is due to commentators. 
        <br><br>
        The Aryabhatiya presented a number of innovations in mathematics and astronomy in verse form, which were influential for many centuries. The extreme brevity of the text was elaborated in commentaries by his disciple Bhaskara I (Bhashya, c. 600 CE) and by Nilakantha Somayaji in his Aryabhatiya Bhasya (1465 CE).
        <br><br>
        The Aryabhatiya is also remarkable for its description of relativity of motion. He expressed this relativity thus: "Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees the stationary objects (on the shore) as moving backward, just so are the stationary stars seen by the people on earth as moving exactly towards the west."

      <h2>Contribution in Mathematics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Place value system and zero</li>
        <li>Approximation of π</li>
        <li>Trigonometry</li>
        <li>Indeterminate equations</li>
        <li>Algebra</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contribution in Astronomy</h2>
      <p>Aryabhata's system of astronomy was called the audAyaka system, in which days are reckoned from uday, dawn at lanka or "equator". Some of his later writings on astronomy, which apparently proposed a second model (or ardha-rAtrikA, midnight) are lost but can be partly reconstructed from the discussion in Brahmagupta's Khandakhadyaka. In some texts, he seems to ascribe the apparent motions of the heavens to the Earth's rotation. He may have believed that the planet's orbits as elliptical rather than circular.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Motions of the Solar System</li>
        <li>Eclipses</li>
        <li>Sidereal periods</li>
        <li>Heliocentrism</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>Aryabhata's work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several neighbouring cultures through translations. The Arabic translation during the Islamic Golden Age (c. 820 CE), was particularly influential. Some of his results are cited by Al-Khwarizmi and in the 10th century Al-Biruni stated that Aryabhata's followers believed that the Earth rotated on its axis.
        <br><br>
      Aryabhata's astronomical calculation methods were also very influential. Along with the trigonometrictables, they came to be widely used in the Islamic world and used to compute many Arabic astronomicaltables (zijes). In particular, the astronomical tables in the work of the Arabic Spain scientist Al-Zarqali(11th century) were translated into Latin as the Tables of Toledo (12th century) and remained the mostaccurate ephemeris used in Europe for centuries.

          <td id="first-sat">India's first satellite Aryabhata and the lunar crater Aryabhata are both named in his honour, the Aryabhata satellite also featured on the reverse of the Indian 2-rupee note. An Institute for conducting research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences is the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) near Nainital, India. The inter-school Aryabhata Maths Competition is also named after him,[44] as is Bacillus aryabhata, a species of bacteria discovered in the stratosphere by ISRO scientists in 2009.</td>
